# Web-Calculator-Project-HTML-CSS-JavaScript-
I built a simple and responsive web-based calculator as my first front-end project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The goal of this project was to strengthen my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic UI design.

🔹 Features

Clean and modern calculator UI

Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

Real-time input display

Clear (C) button to reset calculations

Responsive layout using CSS Grid

🔹 Technical Highlights

Used HTML for structure and layout

Styled the interface with CSS, including hover and active states

Implemented calculator logic in JavaScript

Used the eval() function to evaluate mathematical expressions (for learning and simplicity purposes)

🔹 What I Learned

How to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript

Handling button click events

Structuring a small project from scratch

Styling components for better user experience

This project marks the beginning of my journey into web development, and I’m excited to keep improving by building more projects and learning best practices (like safer alternatives to eval() in the future).

🚀 Feedback and suggestions are welcome!
